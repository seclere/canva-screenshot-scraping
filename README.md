${\textsf{\color{red}HOW IT (CURRENTLY) WORKS}}$

specifications: 
- you do have to have tesseract and tkinter to run this
- until i fix the pathing for tesseractdata you'll also need that...
- it'll upload whatever is in that file into the repo here

(testing repo will have most of the test files until this project is done)

purposes: 
- just to test ocr reading as well as git uploading
